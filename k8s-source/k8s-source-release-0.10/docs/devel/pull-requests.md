Pull Request Process
====================

An overview of how we will manage old or out-of-date pull requests.

Process
-------

We will close any pull requests older than two weeks.

Exceptions can be made for PRs that have active review comments, or that are awaiting other dependent PRs.  Closed pull requests are easy to recreate, and little work is lost by closing a pull request that subsequently needs to be reopened.

We want to limit the total number of PRs in flight to:
* Maintain a clean project
* Remove old PRs that would be difficult to rebase as the underlying code has changed over time
* Encourage code velocity
