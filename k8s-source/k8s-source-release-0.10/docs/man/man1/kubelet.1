.SH NAME
.PP
kubelet \- Processes a container manifest so the containers are launched according to how they are described.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBkubelet\fP [OPTIONS]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBkubernetes\fP kubelet runs on each node. The Kubelet works in terms of a container manifest. A container manifest is a YAML or JSON file that describes a pod. The Kubelet takes a set of manifests that are provided in various mechanisms and ensures that the containers described in those manifests are started and continue running.

.PP
There are 4 ways that a container manifest can be provided to the Kubelet:

.PP
.RS

.nf
File Path passed as a flag on the command line. This file is rechecked every 20 seconds (configurable with a flag).
HTTP endpoint HTTP endpoint passed as a parameter on the command line. This endpoint is checked every 20 seconds (also configurable with a flag).
etcd server The Kubelet will reach out and do a watch on an etcd server. The etcd path that is watched is /registry/hosts/\$(hostname \-f). As this is a watch, changes are noticed and acted upon very quickly.
HTTP server The kubelet can also listen for HTTP and respond to a simple API (underspec'd currently) to submit a new manifest.
