.SH NAME
.PP
kube\-scheduler \- Schedules containers on hosts.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBkube\-scheduler\fP [OPTIONS]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBkubernetes\fP scheduler is a policy\-rich, topology\-aware, workload\-specific function that significantly impacts availability, performance, and capacity. The scheduler needs to take into account individual and collective resource requirements, quality of service requirements, hardware/software/policy constraints, affinity and anti\-affinity specifications, data locality, inter\-workload interference, deadlines, and so on. Workload\-specific requirements will be exposed through the API as necessary.

.PP
The kube\-scheduler can take several options.
